If you're *really* want to read through my *really* bad code, then open a PR outlining what you have done. Thanks!

### Dev

It is a NextJS app made using the new and shiny App Router which I know literally nothing about.

It would probably be ideal to install [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (yes, i am following the hype train).

```shell
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

If you use `npm`, you are probably off fine. (I haven't really tested it).

| Bun             | `npm`           |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| `bun i`         | `npm i`         |
| `bun dev`       | `npm run dev`   |
| `bun run build` | `npm run build` |

Note: builds are placed in `/dist`.
